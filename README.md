## Machine learning models
To run Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Adaboost on preprocessed data, please run the following command in terminal in the following directory: `src/` and make sure preprocessed data is in the directory: `data/preprocessed_data/`. The results will be printed in the terminal. The Anaconda base environment is enough for these models.

    python ml_models.py --model LR

The mortality rate of training set is:0.135345

The mortality rate of training set is:0.11557478

The Accuracy tells us that machine learning approahes have power to do better than ramdon guess which suggests a more advanced time series model could produce a better prediction.
